# Data_Preprocessing
> Data preprocessing is the process of transforming raw data into a clean, organized, and structured format suitable for analysis or modeling. It is a critical step in the data pipeline to ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and usable for deriving insights or building machine learning models.

> Steps in Data Preprocessing: Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Reduction, Data Integration, Data Encoding

## Dataset
In this data preprocessing, I created a simple data. _Note: Data is created for learning purposes and not necessarily a fact_
|Country | Age |Salary |	Purchased|
|-------|------|-------|-----------|
|Poland	|54	|82000	| No |
|Germany|	37	|58000	|Yes|
|United States|	40	|64000|	No|
|Germany |48|	71000	|No|
|United States|	50|	|	Yes|
|Poland	|45|	68000|	Yes|
|Germany	|  |	62000	|No|
|Poland|	58|	89000|	Yes|
|United States	|60	|93000	|No|
|Poland	|47	|77000|	Yes|

__As you can see, we have empty cells, two types of categorical data: country(3 categories) and Purchased(2 categories)__

## Coding Outline:
+ Importing the libraries
+ Importing the dataset
+ Taking care of missing data
+ Encoding categorical data
+ Encoding the Independent Variable
+ Encoding the Dependent Variable
+ Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
+ Feature Scaling
